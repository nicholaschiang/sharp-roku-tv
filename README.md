# `sharp-roku-tv`

This repository implements a very simple UI for playing video in seeming
full-screen mode on a Sharp Roku TV with [overscan display
issues](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202763).

> This is a very simple fix for display overscan that simply renders the
> movie or TV show you want to watch in a styled HTML `<video>` tag that
> adds padding to compensate for overscan. To adjust this padding, update
> `styles.css`. To change the source of the `<video>`, update
> `index.html`. Note that you'll probably want to open this HTML file in
> your browser's full-screen mode (and hide the browser search bar ofc).
